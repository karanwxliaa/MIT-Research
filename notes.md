#Notes.

## Basic Overview

### CAD (Computer-Aided Design)

- **What**: CAD files are used to design, analyze, and optimize products and parts in various engineering fields. These files can represent 2D drawings and 3D models.
- **Why**: CAD is used extensively in engineering for creating precise designs and simulations that can be tested and modified before manufacturing.
- **How**: CAD software allows users to create geometric shapes, assemble parts, and apply materials and constraints to simulate real-world behavior.
- **Drawback**: CAD software can have a steep learning curve and can be expensive, limiting accessibility for hobbyists and small businesses.

### OBJ

- **What**: The OBJ format is a simple data-format that represents 3D geometry alone — namely, the position of each vertex, the UV position of each texture coordinate vertex, vertex normals, and the faces that make polygons defined as a list of vertices.
- **Why**: It's widely used because it's compatible with many 3D graphics applications.
- **How**: OBJ files are typically generated by CAD software and are used for storing and sharing 3D models.
- **Drawback**: The OBJ format does not support advanced features such as animations or complex shaders.

### STL (Stereolithography)

- **What**: STL is a file format native to the stereolithography CAD software created by 3D Systems. This file format is widely used for 3D printing.
- **Why**: It's used for 3D printing because it efficiently describes the surface geometry of a 3D object without any representation of color, texture, or other common model attributes.
- **How**: The STL format represents raw, unstructured triangulated surfaces by the unit normal and vertices of the triangles using a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.
- **Drawback**: It lacks support for color, texture, or any other detailed attributes of a model, limiting its use to mainly prototyping and manufacturing.

### PLY (Polygon File Format or Stanford Triangle Format)

- **What**: The PLY format is a versatile file format for storing 3D data. It can represent data as both structured and unstructured grids, lists of polygons, and even point clouds.
- **Why**: It's used for storing geometric information, such as vertices, edges, and faces of a 3D object, and can also store color and texture information, making it more versatile than STL.
- **How**: PLY files can be in ASCII or binary formats, providing flexibility in terms of readability and file size.
- **Drawback**: Not as widely supported as OBJ or STL formats in some software, potentially leading to compatibility issues.

### GCODE

- **What**: GCODE is a language used for CNC machining and 3D printing. It tells machine tools how to move precisely to manufacture parts or print objects.
- **Why**: It is essential for translating computer-aided designs into instructions that machines can follow to create physical objects.
- **How**: GCODE is generated by slicing software that converts 3D models into layer-by-layer instructions for printing or machining.
- **Drawback**: GCODE is machine-specific, which means that code generated for one type of printer or CNC machine might not work on another without modifications.

### Deep Learning-based SDF (Signed Distance Function) Representation

- **What**: A signed distance function represents a surface by encoding the distance from any point in space to the closest point on the surface, with the sign indicating whether the point is inside or outside.
- **Why**: It's used in machine learning for representing complex geometries in a continuous manner, enabling operations like shape optimization, interpolation, and reconstruction.
- **How**: Deep learning models can learn to approximate SDFs from data, allowing for the generation of detailed and complex 3D shapes from minimal inputs.
- **Drawback**: Requires significant computational resources and large datasets to train the models effectively. Understanding and tweaking SDF-based models can also be challenging.

### NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields)

- **What**: NeRF is a technique for creating 3D models from a set of 2D images. It uses a neural network to map 3D coordinates to color and density, which are used to render new views of the scene.
- **Why**: It allows for highly realistic 3D reconstructions and novel view synthesis from sparse and irregularly spaced photographs.
- **How**: NeRF trains a deep network to predict the color and opacity for every point in space, effectively learning a continuous volumetric scene function.
- **Drawback**: NeRF requires extensive computational resources for training and rendering, and the process can
